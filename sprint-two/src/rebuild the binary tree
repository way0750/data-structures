rebuild the binary tree
should be very easy because everything is still sorted, recursively build smaller arrays from bottom up, and concat them as one big
array, then rebuild that sorted array and use the mid point value as highest node, thus allowing the new tree to be more balanced


minDepth: the highest spot/lowest depth where you can enter a value;
maxDepth: the lowest spot/highest depth where you can enter a  value;

how do you find the depth?
and how do you know the current difference between minDepth and maxDepth?
one place that should know it all is the the parent?
	every time you add a new node, you update its parent on the depth?

every time entering  a new node, you set the depth property and update it upward until the top most node which has no parent;
	but return a minDepth as the return of the that upward propagation
